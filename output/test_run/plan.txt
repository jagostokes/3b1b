TITLE: Linear Transformations as Geometric Operators

ACT 1: Introduction to Linear Transformations (~20s)
- Mobjects: Text("Linear Transformations as Space Movers"), UnitSquare, VectorI (arrow for i-hat), VectorJ (arrow for j-hat), Text("Basis Vectors")
- Animations:
  1. FadeIn Text("Linear Transformations as Space Movers") at top.
  2. ShowCreation UnitSquare centered at origin.
  3. ShowCreation VectorI from origin to (1,0) with label Text("i").
  4. ShowCreation VectorJ from origin to (0,1) with label Text("j").
  5. FadeIn Text("Basis Vectors") below square.
- Notes: Keep labels simple and clear. Ensure vectors are colored distinctly (e.g., red for i, blue for j).

ACT 2: Transforming the Unit Square (~30s)
- Mobjects: UnitSquare (existing), VectorI (existing), VectorJ (existing), Text("Scaling"), Text("Rotation"), Text("Shear"), Text("Reflection")
- Animations:
  1. FadeOut Text("Linear Transformations as Space Movers") and Text("Basis Vectors").
  2. FadeIn Text("Scaling") at top.
  3. Apply scaling matrix (e.g., 2x in x, 0.5x in y) to UnitSquare, VectorI, VectorJ over 2 seconds.
  4. FadeOut Text("Scaling"), FadeIn Text("Rotation").
  5. Apply rotation matrix (e.g., 45 degrees) to UnitSquare, VectorI, VectorJ over 2 seconds.
  6. FadeOut Text("Rotation"), FadeIn Text("Shear").
  7. Apply shear matrix (e.g., shear x by y) to UnitSquare, VectorI, VectorJ over 2 seconds.
  8. FadeOut Text("Shear"), FadeIn Text("Reflection").
  9. Apply reflection matrix (e.g., over y-axis) to UnitSquare, VectorI, VectorJ over 2 seconds.
- Notes: Reset to original state between transformations for clarity, but don’t animate the reset (instantaneous). Use distinct colors for each transformation type if possible.

ACT 3: Grid Deformation (~25s)
- Mobjects: Grid (array of lines forming a 5x5 grid), Text("Grid Deformation")
- Animations:
  1. FadeOut UnitSquare, VectorI, VectorJ, Text("Reflection").
  2. FadeIn Text("Grid Deformation") at top.
  3. ShowCreation Grid centered at origin.
  4. Apply scaling matrix to Grid over 2 seconds.
  5. Reset Grid, then apply rotation matrix over 2 seconds.
  6. Reset Grid, then apply shear matrix over 2 seconds.
  7. Reset Grid, then apply reflection matrix over 2 seconds.
- Notes: Grid should be light gray to avoid visual clutter. Transformations should match those in Act 2 for consistency.

ACT 4: Points Following Basis Vectors (~20s)
- Mobjects: Grid (existing), DotP (single point), VectorI (reintroduced), VectorJ (reintroduced), Text("Points Follow Basis")
- Animations:
  1. FadeOut Text("Grid Deformation").
  2. FadeIn Text("Points Follow Basis") at top.
  3. ShowCreation DotP at a random position on Grid (e.g., (1.5, 0.5)).
  4. ShowCreation VectorI and VectorJ again at origin.
  5. Apply a transformation (e.g., rotation) to Grid, VectorI, VectorJ, and DotP simultaneously over 2 seconds.
  6. Highlight DotP’s movement as a linear combination of VectorI and VectorJ with dashed lines or fading arrows if possible.
- Notes: Ensure DotP is brightly colored (e.g., yellow) to stand out. Highlighting movement can be subtle to avoid overcomplicating the scene.

ACT 5: Matrix Multiplication as Composition (~25s)
- Mobjects: Grid (existing), Text("Composition of Transformations"), Text("Matrix A"), Text("Matrix B"), Text("A then B")
- Animations:
  1. FadeOut Text("Points Follow Basis"), DotP, VectorI, VectorJ.
  2. FadeIn Text("Composition of Transformations") at top.
  3. FadeIn Text("Matrix A") below.
  4. Apply first transformation (e.g., scaling) to Grid over 2 seconds.
  5. FadeOut Text("Matrix A"), FadeIn Text("Matrix B").
  6. Apply second transformation (e.g., rotation) to Grid over 2 seconds.
  7. FadeOut Text("Matrix B"), FadeIn Text("A then B").
  8. Reset Grid, then apply combined transformation (scaling then rotation) over 2 seconds.
- Notes: Use text to label each step clearly. Combined transformation should visually match the sequential application.

ACT 6: Determinants and Area Scaling (~20s)
- Mobjects: UnitSquare (reintroduced), Text("Determinant = Area Scaling"), Text("Area Before"), Text("Area After")
- Animations:
  1. FadeOut Grid, Text("Composition of Transformations"), Text("A then B").
  2. FadeIn Text("Determinant = Area Scaling") at top.
  3. ShowCreation UnitSquare at origin.
  4. FadeIn Text("Area Before") with value (e.g., "1 unit²") next to UnitSquare.
  5. Apply transformation (e.g., scaling by 2x in x, 1x in y) to UnitSquare over 2 seconds.
  6. FadeOut Text("Area Before"), FadeIn Text("Area After") with value (e.g., "2 units²").
- Notes: Use a simple transformation where determinant is easy to interpret as area change. Text should include Unicode "²" for square units.

CLOSING (~10s)
- Mobjects: UnitSquare (existing), VectorEig (arrow for eigenvector), Text("Eigenvectors: Invariant Directions")
- Animations:
  1. FadeOut Text("Determinant = Area Scaling"), Text("Area After").
  2. FadeIn Text("Eigenvectors: Invariant Directions") at top.
  3. ShowCreation VectorEig along a direction that remains scaled but not rotated under the transformation (e.g., along x-axis for scaling).
  4. Apply transformation to UnitSquare and VectorEig, showing VectorEig only scales without changing direction over 2 seconds.
  5. FadeOut all elements slowly.
- Notes: Keep eigenvector concept simple—focus on visual invariance. Use a distinct color for VectorEig (e.g., green).
