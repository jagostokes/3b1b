TITLE: Linear Transformations as Geometric Operators

ACT 1: Introduction to Linear Transformations (~10s)
- Mobjects: Title text, unit square, basis vectors (i, j as arrows)
- Animations: 
  - Fade in title.
  - Draw unit square and basis vectors.
  - Title moves to top edge.

ACT 2: Basis Vector Transformations (~15s)
- Mobjects: 2x2 matrix text (scaling example), transformed basis vectors, transformed square
- Animations:
  - Introduce a scaling matrix (e.g., [[2, 0], [0, 1]]).
  - Animate basis vectors stretching (i to 2i, j unchanged).
  - Show unit square deforming to rectangle based on new basis.

ACT 3: Grid Deformation for Different Transformations (~20s)
- Mobjects: NumberPlane (grid), text labels for each transformation
- Animations:
  - Show grid background.
  - Animate scaling: grid stretches horizontally.
  - Transition to rotation (e.g., 90 degrees): grid rotates.
  - Transition to shear (e.g., [[1, 1], [0, 1]]): grid slants.
  - Transition to reflection (e.g., over y-axis): grid flips.

ACT 4: Matrix Multiplication as Composition (~15s)
- Mobjects: Two matrix texts, combined transformation label
- Animations:
  - Show two matrices (e.g., rotation then shear).
  - Animate grid undergoing first transformation, then second.
  - Label as composition of transformations.

ACT 5: Determinant as Area Scaling (~10s)
- Mobjects: Unit square, transformed square, area labels
- Animations:
  - Show unit square with area=1.
  - Apply transformation (e.g., scaling by 2 and 1).
  - Show new area (e.g., 2) and link to determinant.

ACT 6: Eigenvectors as Invariant Directions (~15s)
- Mobjects: Eigenvector arrows, transformation matrix text
- Animations:
  - Show a transformation (e.g., scaling).
  - Highlight vectors that only scale, not rotate (eigenvectors).
  - Animate transformation to show invariance of direction.

CLOSING (~5s)
- Fade out all elements with a final text "Linear Transformations".
