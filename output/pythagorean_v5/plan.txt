TITLE: Pythagorean Theorem

ACT 1: Introduction & Triangle Setup (~10s)
- Mobjects: Title text, right triangle with vertices A, B, C, sides labeled a, b, c, right angle marker
- Animations: 
  - Fade in title, wait, shrink to top
  - Show creation of triangle sides one by one
  - Fade in side labels (a, b, c) with colors
  - Show right angle marker with emphasis
- Voice-over cue: "The Pythagorean Theorem applies to right triangles. Here, we have a triangle with sides labeled a, b, and c, where c is the hypotenuse."

ACT 2: Squares on Sides (~15s)
- Mobjects: Squares on sides a, b, c with corresponding colors, area labels (a², b², c²)
- Animations:
  - Build square on side b (base), fade in label b²
  - Build square on side c (vertical), fade in label c²
  - Build square on side a (hypotenuse), fade in label a²
- Voice-over cue: "We construct squares on each side. The area of each square represents the square of the side length: b squared, c squared, and a squared."

ACT 3: Visual Proof & Equation (~15s)
- Mobjects: Equation text "a² + b² = c²"
- Animations:
  - Highlight squares on sides b and c together to suggest their combined area
  - Highlight square on side a to show it equals the sum
  - Fade in the equation at the bottom as a summary
- Voice-over cue: "The Pythagorean Theorem states that the sum of the areas of the squares on the two shorter sides, a squared plus b squared, equals the area of the square on the hypotenuse, c squared."

CLOSING (~5s)
- Fade out all elements except equation, hold for impact, then fade out completely
- Voice-over cue: "This fundamental relationship is the basis for many geometric proofs and applications."

TOTAL: ~45s
