TITLE: Pythagorean Theorem

ACT 1: Introduction & Triangle Setup (~10s)
- Mobjects: Title text, right triangle with vertices A, B, C, sides labeled a, b, c (hypotenuse), right angle marker
- Animations: 
  1. Fade in title, pause, shrink to top
  2. Show creation of triangle sides one by one
  3. Fade in side labels (a, b, c) with colors (BLUE for a, GREEN for b, RED for c)
  4. Show right angle marker to emphasize it's a right triangle
- Voice-over cue: "The Pythagorean Theorem applies to right triangles. Here, sides a and b are the legs, and c is the hypotenuse."

ACT 2: Building Squares on Sides (~12s)
- Mobjects: Squares on sides a, b, c with matching colors and area labels (a², b², c²)
- Animations:
  1. Build square on side a (BLUE), fade in label a²
  2. Build square on side b (GREEN), fade in label b²
  3. Build square on side c (RED), fade in label c²
- Voice-over cue: "Let's construct squares on each side. The area of each square represents the square of the side length: a squared, b squared, and c squared."

ACT 3: Visual Proof of a² + b² = c² (~15s)
- Mobjects: Highlighting effects, equation text
- Animations:
  1. Highlight squares of a and b together with Indicate animation to suggest their combined area
  2. Highlight square of c with Indicate to compare
  3. Fade in equation "a² + b² = c²" at bottom as summary of visual proof
- Voice-over cue: "Notice that the combined area of the squares on sides a and b equals the area of the square on side c. This is the Pythagorean Theorem: a squared plus b squared equals c squared."

CLOSING (~8s)
- Mobjects: Final text message
- Animations:
  1. Fade out all triangle and square elements
  2. Fade in closing message "a² + b² = c²"
  3. Hold for impact, then fade out
- Voice-over cue: "The Pythagorean Theorem: a fundamental relationship in geometry."

TOTAL: ~45s
