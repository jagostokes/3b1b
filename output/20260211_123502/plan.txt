TITLE: Understanding the Chain Rule

ACT 1: Introduction to Composition (~10s)
- Mobjects: Title text, two function labels (g(x) and f(u)), and a composition label f(g(x)).
- Animations: 
  - Fade in title, wait, then shrink to top.
  - Introduce g(x) as the inner function, then f(u) as the outer function.
  - Combine them visually into f(g(x)) with an arrow or transformation to show composition.
- Voice-over cue: "The chain rule helps us differentiate composite functions. We start with an inner function g(x), and an outer function f(u), which together form f of g of x."

ACT 2: Visualizing Nested Functions (~12s)
- Mobjects: Axes, graph of inner function g(x) = x², graph of outer function f(u) = sin(u), and resulting composite graph f(g(x)) = sin(x²).
- Animations:
  - Draw axes and graph g(x) = x², label it.
  - Show transformation to f(u) = sin(u) (perhaps a separate small graph or overlay).
  - Morph or indicate how g(x) feeds into f(u) to produce the composite graph sin(x²).
- Voice-over cue: "Imagine g of x equals x squared. Then f of u equals sine of u. When we compose them, we get sine of x squared. Let's see how the rates of change combine."

ACT 3: Rates of Change - Inner and Outer (~12s)
- Mobjects: Dots on g(x) graph for input and output, tangent lines for slopes, labels for dg/dx and df/du.
- Animations:
  - Place a dot on g(x) at x=1, show tangent for dg/dx (slope of inner).
  - Map output of g(x) to input of f(u), show tangent for df/du (slope of outer).
  - Highlight both slopes with labels, emphasize they are separate rates.
- Voice-over cue: "The chain rule says the derivative of the composite is the product of the derivatives. At x equals 1, g of x has a certain slope, dg/dx. That output becomes the input to f, where f has its own slope, df/du."

ACT 4: Chain Rule Formula (~10s)
- Mobjects: Text for chain rule formula df/dx = df/du * dg/dx, numerical values for slopes.
- Animations:
  - Fade in the chain rule formula at the bottom.
  - Show numerical slopes (e.g., dg/dx = 2x = 2 at x=1, df/du = cos(u) at u=1²=1), multiply them.
  - Indicate the result as the slope of the composite function.
- Voice-over cue: "The chain rule tells us df/dx equals df/du times dg/dx. Here, at x equals 1, it's cosine of 1 times 2, giving us the derivative of the composite function."

CLOSING (~6s)
- Mobjects: Summary text "Chain Rule: Derivative of Composite = Outer' * Inner'".
- Animations:
  - Fade out all graphs and labels.
  - Fade in summary text, hold for impact, then fade out.
- Voice-over cue: "Remember, the chain rule multiplies the derivatives of the outer and inner functions to find the rate of change of the composite."
