A visual, intuition-driven exploration of linear transformations that treats matrices not as tables of numbers but as geometric operators that move space. Start with how the unit square and basis vectors transform under different matrices, then show how every point follows from those basis movements. Animate scaling, rotation, shear, and reflection as continuous deformations of a grid. Build toward matrix multiplication as composition of transformations and determinants as area scaling. Close by linking eigenvectors to directions that remain invariant under the motion.
